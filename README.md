This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:  
and when installing something new
```bash
npm install
# or
npm i
```
then
```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

If you see the canvas duplicated, that's because of nextjs dev environment. It'll be fixed when you use 
```bash
npm start
```
instead of `npm run dev`
